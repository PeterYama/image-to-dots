# dot-to-dot
Converts images into full dot to dot puzzles.

To use, clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/ostenbom/dot-to-dot.git`, install requirements (you'll particularly need a Cairo binding like cairocffi and Pillow). Then run:

```
python Main.py path/to/image.jpg
```

If you'd like to know more about how it works, reading DotToDot.py is a good start! Also the medium article I wrote, more documentation coming soon.
